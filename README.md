## NumPy

### What is NumPy?

Python library that adds support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with many high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Tensors

### What is a Tensor?

Tensors are a specialised data structure similar to arrays.

### How do I implement a Tensor in C?

Is this something that can be done, or would it only be used in the context of a library? Seems to be library specific, and an array would be used for interoperability (or data initialisation.

### What differentiates a tensor from an array?

https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/03/19/difference-between-tensors-and-arrays/

An array is a grid of values that contains raw data and we use it to locate and interpret elements in the raw data.


Tensors are backed by the accelerator memory like GPU and they are immutable, unlike NumPy arrays.
